# 🗳️ Spatiotemporal Analysis of Indonesia’s Election: Sentiment & Hate Speech

This project presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of political sentiment and hate speech trends surrounding the 2019 and 2024 Indonesian general elections. Leveraging natural language processing (NLP), geospatial analysis, and visualization techniques, we aim to uncover public discourse patterns on platforms like Twitter and YouTube.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `WrapItUp80.ipynb`:  
  Contains the core pipeline for **sentiment analysis**, including data preprocessing, sentiment scoring, and temporal pattern discovery using Indonesian-language social media data.

- `WrapHate.ipynb`:  
  Focuses on **hate speech detection**, using labeled datasets and model-based classification. Results are evaluated over time to highlight peaks in hate-related content during the election cycles.

## 🧠 Key Features

- **Fine-tuning of IndoBERT** for Indonesian sentiment and hate speech classification  
- **Temporal analysis** to identify shifts in public opinion and toxic discourse  
- **Interactive mapping** of province-level insights for both 2019 and 2024 elections  
- Insights into how political events influence online narratives  

## 📊 Technologies Used

- `Python` — Data processing & modeling  
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` — Data manipulation  
- `Scikit-learn`, `Transformers (Huggingface)` — Machine learning & NLP  
- `Matplotlib`, `Plotly` — Visualization  

## 📌 Insights & Contributions

This research helps policymakers, media analysts, and researchers understand:
- How online sentiment evolved across the two election cycles  
- Regional differences in political opinion and hate speech  
- The impact of digital discourse on democratic processes
